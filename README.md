# Psy-Cats: _The Second Awakening_

__Concept__:
Sentient, psychic cats in a cyberpunk future where “magic” is returning  to the world at an increasing rate, but only these sentient cats and the humans they imprint with are aware of this hidden world...so far.
Something is out there waiting in the dark beyond the warm glow of our sun and it’s somehow related to the return of magic.
Will you unlock the mysteries within or be lost to the hidden city?

__Thesis__:
Feline roleplaying that uses an narrative/emotion based system in order to convey exciting and mind-bending stories in a hidden world with themes of psychedelia, psychic-transhumanism, magic, mystery, and fantasy, all juxtaposed on a post-cyberpunk world in which technological-transhumanism has lifted the social elite well beyond traditional “godhood”.
